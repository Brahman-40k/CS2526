Tom always had a way of annoying everyone in class.
He would make ****** jokes that no one laughed at and acted like a total ***** whenever someone tried to correct him. One day, he called Sarah a ***** just because she didn’t understand his **** explanation of a C++ program.

Later, he tried to impress the group by making a **** joke about *****, which only made him look like a ****.
Sarah thought he was being a ****, but when he started telling ****** stories and called them ‘******* humor,’ everyone knew he was just a ***** trying too hard to fit in.
