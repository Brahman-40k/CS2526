Tom always had a way of annoying everyone in class.
He would make stupid jokes that no one laughed at and acted like a total idiot whenever someone tried to correct him. One day, he called Sarah a loser just because she didn’t understand his dumb explanation of a C++ program.

Later, he tried to impress the group by making a lame joke about drugs, which only made him look like a fool.
Sarah thought he was being a jerk, but when he started telling creepy stories and called them ‘naughty humor,’ everyone knew he was just a moron trying too hard to fit in.
